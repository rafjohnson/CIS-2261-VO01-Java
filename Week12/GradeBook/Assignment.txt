Grade Book
A teacher has five students who have taken ***four*** tests. The teacher uses the following grading
scale to assign a letter grade to a student, based on the average of his or her four test
scores.
Test Score Letter Grade
90–100 A
80–89 B
70–79 C
60–69 D
0–59 F
Write a class that uses a 
*String array (or an ArrayList object) to hold the five students’ names, 
*an array of five characters to hold the five students’ letter grades, 
*and five arrays of four doubles each to hold each student’s set of test scores. 

The class should have methods that 
* return a specific student’s name, 
* average test score, 
* and a letter grade based on the average.

Demonstrate the class in a program that allows the user to enter each student’s name and
his or her four test scores. It should then display each student’s average test score and letter
grade.
Input validation: Do not accept test scores less than zero or greater than 100.
