Payroll Program
Write a Payroll program that uses the following arrays as fields:

* employeeId. An array of seven integers to hold employee identification numbers. The
array should be initialized with the following numbers:
5658845   4520125   7895122   8777541   8451277   1302850   7580489
*hours. An array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each
employee.
*payRate. An array of seven doubles to hold each employee’s hourly pay rate
wages. An array of seven doubles to hold each employee’s gross wages

The program should relate the data in each array through the subscripts. 
For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by the
employee whose identification number is stored in element 0 of the employeeId array. That
same employee’s pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array.

In addition to the appropriate accessor and mutator methods, 
* the class should have a method that accepts an employee’s identification number as an argument and returns the
gross pay for that employee.

Demonstrate the class in a complete program that displays each employee number and asks
the user to enter that employee’s hours and pay rate. It should then display each employee’s
identification number and gross wages.

Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for hours or numbers less than 6.00 for pay rate.
