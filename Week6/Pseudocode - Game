Create a number guessing game.
Generate a random number between 1 and 50.
Have the user guess a number.
If the user guesses wrong give them hints to guess higher or lower.
Keep track of the number of guesses. When they guess it correctly give
them some feedback on how well they did and the number of guesses it
took.

int randNum = rand(1-50)
int guess
bool gotItRight
int guessCount

do while gotItRight = false
{
    print "enter a number betwen 1-50"
    input guess
    if valid //within 1-50
        if guess>randNum
            guessCount++
            print "too high"
        elseif guess<rand num
            guessCount++
            print "too low"
        else
            guessCount++
            gotItRight = true
    else    
        guessCount++
        invalid number
}
 print "number was x, you found it in guessCount guesses"
